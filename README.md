# Ping Master
## Your Reliable Network Monitoring Tool
Ping Master is an essential tool designed to help network administrators and IT professionals monitor and maintain network stability. With Ping Master, you can easily check the availability and response times of servers, websites, and network devices.

## Getting Started
### Environment Dependencies
- Xcode 15+
- iOS 16+
- SwiftUI
- Swift Package Manager(SPM) Dependencies
	- [NetworkPinger](https://github.com/muneerkk66/NetWorkPinger)
	- [Nuke](https://github.com/kean/Nuke)
	- [SwiftInj](https://github.com/Swinject/Swinject)
	- [Swift-snapshot-testing](https://github.com/pointfreeco/swift-snapshot-testing)

  
### Project Setup
1. Clone the repository.
2. Finally, navigate to the root folder run Xcode

## Important Note on Unit test

**Please Note:** To execute unit tests, ensure that you run them twice to ensure all tests are accurately executed. I've employed the snapshot testing framework. We should only automatically record if no screenshot exists for this test. When running unit tests for the first time, ensure that you run them twice to generate the appropriate screens for UI testing.  **Test coverage: 78%** 


## How to use app
Open the app to explore two main sections: the primary view displays the current latency of each host and offers options to sort the list and recheck latency for specific host. Additionally, you can click on any item in the table to visit the host's URL..

## Project Structure
iOS Project implemented with Clean Layered Architecture and MVVM-Coordinator pattern. 

## Layers
* **Domain Layer** = Entities + Use Cases + Repositories Interfaces
* **Data Repositories Layer** = Repositories Implementations + API (Network)
* **Presentation Layer (MVVM)** = ViewModels + Views

### Dependency Direction

* **PingMaster**(iOS Project): This folder contains the resources, source files and all other miscellaneous files to build the iOS project. This folder is further branched into:
	 The app is completely written in SwiftUI/Combine.

## What needs to be improved ##
### Required
1. Add UI test.
2. Improve unit test coverage 
3. Add support for Dark mode

### Tools have the capacity to be incorporated.
 1. - [Arkana](https://github.com/rogerluan/arkana) is used to handle/manage/store project keys secretely.
Arkana requires the declaration of a YAML config file, named e.g. `.arkana.yml` that lists the keys (names) and an `.env` (e.g. `.env.arkana`) file that stores the values for the keys stored in the YAML file. Since the `.env.arkana` file contains the actual values of the secrets, it should be stored locally and never be checked-in to the repository (It has already been added to `.gitignore`).
2. - [SwiftGen](https://github.com/SwiftGen/SwiftGen) is a tool allowing to parse the app's various assets (including but not limited to xibs, storyboards, fonts, assets library, strings file, etc). This app is built to use SwiftGen to generate 3 kinds of compile-time constants related to:
3. - [SwiftLint](https://github.com/realm/SwiftLint/) is a tool that parses `swift` files, and output warnings when a code-smell is identified. Sometimes, SwiftLint outputs warnings for desired code, and in these cases the warnings may be disabled in code.
